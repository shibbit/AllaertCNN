# Note
The AllaertCNN is designed for facial expression optical flows classification task. And this project was composed for CASME dataset, you can apply them here:http://casme.psych.ac.cn/casme/. Or you can train the network on your own dataset.

# Demo
The pretrained pt file on CASME II is provided. With the accuracy of predictions on original testset(5166 images): 79.07%ã€‚
You can run *my_test_which_I_don't_know_if_it's_solid.py*, and load the *Test_model_5-14_backup.t7* from Modelsave directory.
